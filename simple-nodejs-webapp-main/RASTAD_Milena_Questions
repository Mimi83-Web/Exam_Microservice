Q1:

Microservices architecture is a method of developing a single application as a set of small, independent services, each running in its own process and communicating typically via HTTP-based APIs. 
These services are organized around specific business capabilities and can be deployed independently using automated systems.

In contrast, a monolithic application is built as a single unified unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are tightly integrated and interdependent. 
Updating or scaling a part of the application often requires rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.

Q2:

Microservices Pros:
Scalability: Individual services can be scaled as needed.
Flexibility: Allows for using different technologies for different services.
Agility: Easier management due to smaller, more manageable codebases.
Resilience: Failures in one service have limited impact on the entire application.

Microservices Cons:
Complexity: Increased complexity due to multiple services.
Distributed System Challenges: Includes issues like network latency and message serialization.
Data Integrity: Difficulties in maintaining consistent data across services.
Operational Overhead: Increased need for robust operations, monitoring, and logging systems.

Monolithic Pros:
Simplicity: Straightforward to develop, test, deploy, and initially scale.
Performance: Faster intra-process communication.
Transaction Management: Simpler within a single database context.

Monolithic Cons:
Scalability: Scaling requires scaling the entire application.
Flexibility: Limited to a single technology stack.
Agility: Large codebases become difficult to manage.
Resilience: A single module's failure can affect the entire application.

Q3:

In microservices architecture, applications should be divided based on business domain boundaries, aligning with the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). 
This division ensures that each microservice encapsulates a specific core business capability (1 domain = 1 bounded countext).

Q4:

The CAP theorem posits that a distributed system cannot simultaneously achieve Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance at the same time. In the context of microservices:

Consistency: Every read operation receives the most recent write or an error.
Availability: Every request receives a response, but not necessarily the most recent data.
Partition Tolerance: The system continues to operate despite network failures.

This theorem is guides the balance and trade-offs between these three aspects based on specific business requirements.

Q5:

Due to the CAP theorem, microservices architecture must make strategic trade-offs, influencing its design. 
For example, prioritizing consistency may lead to a system that sacrifices availability, using traditional transactional mechanisms. 
Conversely, prioritizing availability may lead to eventual consistency, offering a responsive user experience at the expense of having the most up-to-date data.

Q6:

Microservices enhance scalability in cloud environments by allowing individual services to be scaled separately. 
For instance, in a high-demand scenario for an e-commerce platform's payment processing service, only the payment service can be scaled up by 
deploying more instances on additional cloud resources, without needing to scale the entire application.

Q7:

Statelessness in microservices refers to the principle where each request from a client contains all necessary information to process that request. 
This approach is crucial in microservices for enabling independent scalability and redeployment of services, as there's no need for shared state between instances. 
It also enhances system resilience, as any service instance can process any request at any time.

Q8: 

An API Gateway serves as the entry point for clients accessing microservices, performing several key functions:

Request Routing: Directing incoming requests to the appropriate microservices.
Aggregation: Combining responses from various services for the client.
Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring security of requests.
Rate Limiting: Controlling the number of requests from users.
Load Balancing: Distributing incoming traffic across service instances.
Logging and Metrics: Gathering traffic and performance data for analysis.
